Chess AI Engine with Neural Networks

This project is a Chess AI Engine built using Pygame for the graphical interface and TensorFlow for the neural network model. The engine allows a human player to compete against an AI that predicts the best moves based on a pre-trained model. The AI is trained using historical chess games stored in PGN (Portable Game Notation) format.

Project Structure
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key files and directories in this project:


How the Chess AI Works
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Historical chess games are stored in PGN format. These games are parsed and preprocessed into a format that the neural network model can understand.
Each chess board state is converted into a 3D tensor (12x8x8), and each corresponding move is encoded as an integer index.
The processed data is stored in X.npy (board states) and y.npy (moves).
Neural Network Training:

The neural network is trained to predict the best move given a particular board state.
The model uses TensorFlow and is trained using the data in X.npy and y.npy. After training, the model is saved as chess_ai_model.h5.
Game Execution:

The chess game is played using Pygame, with the human player playing as white, and the AI (black) using the trained neural network model to predict its moves.
The AI predicts its move by analyzing the current board state and choosing the best move according to the model's output.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
Pip (Python package installer)
Git (optional, if cloning from GitHub)
Installation
Clone the repository (or download it):
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/chess_engine.git
cd chess_engine
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Chess Game
Once all dependencies are installed and your environment is set up:

bash
Copy code
python chess_game.py
This will launch the Pygame window, allowing you to play chess against the AI.

Training the Model
If you wish to retrain the neural network or add more data:

Collect more PGN files and place them in the appropriate directory.
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to generate the new X.npy and y.npy datasets:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
Train the model using the train_model.py script:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py
The trained model will be saved as chess_ai_model.h5, which will be used by the chess game to predict moves.

File Descriptions
chess_game.py: Main script that runs the chess game using Pygame and the trained AI.
data_preprocessing.py: Preprocesses PGN chess games into a format suitable for training the neural network.
train_model.py: Trains the neural network using the processed chess data and saves the model as chess_ai_model.h5.
chess_ai_model.h5: The trained neural network model used by the AI to predict moves during the game.
move_dict.json and reverse_move_dict.json: Dictionaries for converting chess moves to numerical indices and vice versa.
assets/: Folder containing images of chess pieces used in the Pygame interface.
X.npy and y.npy: Preprocessed input and output data for training the neural network model.
Dependencies
